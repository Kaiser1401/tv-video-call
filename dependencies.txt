Microphone problems in chromium?
try changing the input settings a bit in the systems sound settings
for me either alsamixer or pulseaudio helped (apt install)

Add udev rule so that the buttons always have the same device name:
copy 11-arduino_clone.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/
(change vendor and product id accordingly (lsusb))

add user to dialout group to allow serial access:
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

restart after the group add (actually re-login)
